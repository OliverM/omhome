# omhome

A first pass at implementing a personal website using clojure. This implementation is initially a static site. Code only; blog and styling content are deliberately excluded in the hope that this might help ensure it'll be useful for somebody else.

## Installation

Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/OliverM/omhome), if you like.

## Usage

TBD

## Options

FIXME: listing of options this app accepts.

## Examples

The main (and potentially only) example should be visible at http://olivermooney.com

### Bugs

Is the current lack of functionality a bug?

### To Do
1. Follow the steps in <http://cjohansen.no/building-static-sites-in-clojure-with-stasis> as a starting point
2. Setup a basic implementation using [PureCSS](http://purecss.io) as a neat minimal starting point that doesn't interfere by pulling in libraries like jQuery.
3. Deploy a this minimal version to a host for testing purposes
4. Generate straight HTML templates and populate them using Enlive; might even be able to use the PureCSS blog example directly??
5. Integration; twitter & github activity, linkedin...?
