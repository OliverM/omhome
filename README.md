# omhome

A first pass at implementing a personal website using clojure. This implementation is a static site suitable for hosting on GitHub Pages and similar services offering static resource hosting. Key building blocks are the Hiccup, Stasis and Optimus Clojure libraries, and the Tufte CSS stylesheet. More on these choices below.

## Installation

Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/OliverM/omhome), if you like.

## Examples

The main (and potentially only) example should be visible at http://olivermooney.com

## Implementation Status
Currently Hiccup- and Markdown-based workflows are in place for individual articles, with a meta structure available directing where the articles should be located by URL, and a few other features. Most pressing is a means of generating a front page with a list of articles; once that's in place, even in skeletal form, this'll be deployed as a starting point above (what's there at the moment is a few test articles you can find if you know the URLs directly).

### Done
- Follow the steps in <http://cjohansen.no/building-static-sites-in-clojure-with-stasis> as a starting point
- Setup a basic implementation using [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) as a neat CSS-only starting point that doesn't interfere by pulling in libraries like jQuery.
- Work up a Hiccup-based workflow that uses inline functions to generate the awkward markup for things like sidenotes and margin notes, which are too baroque to implement comfortably in straight HTML
- Integrate markdown-style replacement of apostrophes with smart quotes, prime marks, ellipses etc as appropriate
- Integrate code-presentation CSS a la Cygments

### To Do
- Customise Tufte CSS:
    - Use custom fonts & colours
    - tweak the CSS to match the new font metrics, and (most awkwardly?) integrate a proper baseline system to for visual consistency/pleasure. This'll need integrating Tufte CSS with a CSS system like [Sassline](http://sassline.com), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io), or similar - or, ideally, re-using Facjure's [Mesh](https://github.com/facjure/mesh), which seems to have all the features I'm looking for, only neatly wrapped up using Clojure & [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden). Sass looks okay but if I can do it in Clojure, that's the path to take.
    - Add optical margins a la [Typeset](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Typeset) for ever-closer CSS perfection
    - patch unstyled gaps:
      - unordered (all?) list items have poor leading
- Generate index-creation functions using Enlive
  - Build xml feeds for each topic/keyword
  - allow mini-articles to be woven in to main index only, if they're not given tags?
  - move all index generation to the meta-posts setup
- Integration (on those index pages & the post template):
  - twitter 
  - github activity
  - linkedin...? 
- After all that, time for some fun stuff!
  - Integrate Garden to allow for custom per-post layouts
  - Look at how to create & include per-post clojurescript libraries, to present & play with some interesting tech there (e.g. Quil & more)
