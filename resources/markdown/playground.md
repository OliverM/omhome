#Single hashes give you H1s
<p class=subtitle>Adding a subtitle as a p tag with classes.</p>

##Section heading, which resolves to a H2

> Blockquote time! But how to apply those pesky blockquotes? Can I just type endlessly after opening with a single one? With soft-wraps in my editor handling it the convenient wrapping of same? I can!
<footer>Quote attribution text goes here</footer>

It's not immediately clear if you should wrap paragraphs in p tags, or if individual sentences are enough for the Tufte CSS. Do I have to delve through it by hand? Probably.

<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">One of those classy Tufte sidenotes.</span>
 Continuing on, I'm not enjoying the mangling of the HTML by the Markdown processor, but perhpas there's a case to be made for a Markdownesque format catering just for the Tufte CSS?
