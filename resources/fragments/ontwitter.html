    <h1>Observe a son of Leinster lurking on Twitter, without conclusion</h1>
    <section>
        <p><span class="newthought">I like browsing Twitter,</span> as long as I don't get stuck trying to work out what it is, exactly. It's mostly a fun thing to check when I'm at a loose end. For example, yesterday an old college friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmoynes" title="Limericist at large">John Moynes</a> - he writes limericks for a living these days, from what I can tell - was <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMoynes/status/440112172841336833">practicing satire on the internet</a>.<label for="sn-update" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-update" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">UPDATE: John tells me Facebook for Chimpanzees actually happened</span></p>
        <p>Another friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/etienneshrdlu" title="Designer, developer, and office buddy extraordinaire">James Kelleher</a> (James is a talented designer and developer of the great <a href="http://pilcrow.ie/apps" title="Lonely Beast">Lonely Beast</a> apps, & we're about to start sharing an office) was playing along. It turns out Twitter lets you just jump right in to any conversation, so (five hours after the fact) I added <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverMooney/status/440196685378383872">this</a>.</p>
        <p>That's it. That's all my personal Twitter account is for. James starred my tweet, which was nice. Wait, is that another way of being polite? I did just jump in here. Also I seem to think a 'satirical voice' is Kenneth Williams narrating Jonathan Swift.</p>
        <p>And if that was that, great! But instead sometimes this happens: I get 'followed' by people I meet professionally (weird how 'follow' transitions from something creepy in real life to something desired online) and, each time, I become marginally less likely to tweet. Due to cringing. Please don't read these! I'm just dicking about, here! You're welcome to glance through the half-realised pokes and grunts I pack in to those 160 characters, but subscribe to them? Are you sure you want to do that? Now I feel bad, for the inane nonsense flitting past your screen. There should be a polite way to unsubscribe somebody, for their sake.</p>
        <p>Is it considered polite to follow back? Why? My personal Twitter account is mainly for me to see what my friends like to tweet about, not for work stuff; that's what my work twitter account is for. Not that I use it for that. My work account is subscribed to so many industry bigwigs, many of whom seem to have people tweeting full-time, going by quantity, that I never look at the thing. It's the roar of a packed crowd at a sporting event you got a free ticket for, but it's a sport you've never heard of, the ball's a funny shape, and are those horses?! Thanks, but I have to get back to work.</p>
        <p>Nobody can have the time to hang out on Twitter<label for="sn-misspelt" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-misspelt" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ways I misspelt 'Twitter' while writing this: Teitter, Titter, Twutter (my favourite). </span> all day. James has tried explaining to me that you dip in and out, a bit like checking the weather, I think. But people write this stuff! Don't they expect to be read? Plus, dipping in seems to be done wherever you can. I have friends who do it in the pub. Pint in one hand, phone in the other. It's like those Matrix scenes where they had indecipherable vertically-scrolling green sigils represent the interminable code of the world. They were so close; swap the green for Twitter's colours, and you're there.</p>
