For example, Neil (around 33 minutes into his talk) talks about a notional touch interaction where you've to pick out the opening and closing brackets/tags/quotes of a section of text to highlight them. But who would suggest that?! There's already a great way of selecting the matching closing tag in a text using a mouse: double-click the opening (or closing) tag. IntelliJ does this, and I'm sure others do too. It works " [:emphasis "without"] " you having to even consider the type of tag and finding it's matching symbol on the keyboard.
