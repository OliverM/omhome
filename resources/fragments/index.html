    <h1 class="PublicoText-Roman-Web">Observe a son of Leinster lurking on Twitter, without conclusion</h1>
    <p class="PublicoText-Roman-Web">I like browsing Twitter, as long as I don&rsquo;t get stuck trying to work out what it is, exactly. It&rsquo;s mostly a fun thing to check when I&rsquo;m at a loose end. For example, yesterday an old college friend,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmoynes" title="Limericist at large">John Moynes</a>&nbsp;- he writes limericks for a living these days, from what I can tell - was <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMoynes/status/440112172841336833">practicing satire on the internet</a>&nbsp;[UPDATE: John tells me Facebook for Chimpanzees actually happened]. Another friend,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/etienneshrdlu" title="Designer, developer, and office buddy extraordinaire">James Kelleher</a>&nbsp;(I know James a bit better; he&rsquo;s a talented designer and developer of the great&nbsp;<a href="http://pilcrow.ie/apps" title="Lonely Beast">Lonely Beast</a>&nbsp;apps, plus we&rsquo;re about to start sharing an office) was playing along. It turns out Twitter lets you just jump right in to any conversation, so (five hours after the fact) I added&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/OliverMooney/status/440196685378383872">this</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="PublicoText-Roman-Web"><span><span>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all my personal Twitter account is for. James starred my tweet, which was nice. Wait, is that another way of being polite? I did just jump in here. Also I&nbsp;seem to think a &lsquo;satirical voice&rsquo; is Kenneth Williams narrating Jonathan Swift.</span></span></p>
    <p class="PublicoText-Roman-Web"><span>And if that was that, great! But instead sometimes this happens: I get 'followed&rsquo; by people I meet professionally (weird how 'follow&rsquo; transitions from something creepy in real life to something desired online) and, each time, I become marginally less likely to tweet. Due to cringing. Please don&rsquo;t read these! I&rsquo;m just dicking about, here! You&rsquo;re welcome to glance through the half-realised pokes and grunts I pack in to those 160 characters, but subscribe to them? Are you sure you want to do that? Now I feel bad, for the inane nonsense flitting past your screen. There should be a polite way to unsubscribe somebody, for their sake.</span></p>
    <p class="PublicoText-Roman-Web"><span>Is it considered polite to follow back? Why? My personal Twitter account is mainly for me to see what my friends like to tweet about, not for work stuff; that&rsquo;s what my work twitter account is for. Not that I use it for that. My work account is subscribed to so many industry bigwigs, many of whom seem to have people tweeting full-time, going by quantity, that I never look at the thing. It&rsquo;s the roar of a packed crowd at a sporting event you got a free ticket for, but it&rsquo;s a sport you&rsquo;ve never heard of, the ball&rsquo;s a funny shape, and are those horses?! Thanks, but I have to get back to work.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="PublicoText-Roman-Web"><span>Nobody can have the time to hang out on Twitter all day. James has tried explaining to me that you dip in and out, a bit like checking the weather, I think. But people write this stuff! Don&rsquo;t they expect to be read? Plus, dipping in seems to be done wherever you can. I have friends who do it in the pub. Pint in one hand, phone in the other. It&rsquo;s like those Matrix scenes where they had indecipherable vertically-scrolling green sigils represent the&nbsp; interminable code of the world. They were so close; swap the green for Twitter&rsquo;s colours, and you&rsquo;re there.</span></p>
    <p class="PublicoText-Roman-Web"><span><span>Ways I misspelt 'Twitter&rsquo; while writing this: Teitter, Titter, Twutter. I like Twutter best.</span></span></p>
